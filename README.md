# Predict Next Word
This is a N-gram language model that predicts the next word based on a precalculated conditional probability. This model is trained on bigrams from COCA corpus which can be downloaded from [this link](http://www.ngrams.info/download_coca.asp). 

### Steps to run this script

1. Download the bigram dataset from above provided link. You will need to register with an email ID for doing so. There are three files for bigram model.
  - Non case sensitive - w2_.zip
  - Case sensitive - w2.zip
  - Case sensitive with POS tagging - w2c.zip
  
  We need only the Non case sensitive zip.
  
2. Extract the Non case sensitive zip. You will get *w2_.txt* file. Put this file in the same folder where the scripts 'getTopBigram.py' and 'bigramConditionalProbability.py' are there..

4. Run 'bigramConditionalProbability.py' file using `python bigramConditionalProbability.py`. Note that you will need to have `pickle` module installed before that. You can install it using `pip install pickle`. (It would be recommended to have a virtual environment for such stuff). Previous command will create some pickle dumps in `pickleDumps` directory.
4. Run `python getTopBigram.py` and enjoy :p.
